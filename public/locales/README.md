# Translations

Translation files in this directory are managed on [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/). **Please don't edit the locale files directly.**

To contribute translations:

- Go to https://explore.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/
- Select a language you can help with
- Start translating

Once a resource file reaches 75% completion, it is pulled automatically by the [Transifex sync workflow](../../.github/workflows/tx-pull.yml) and included in this repo.

See [`docs/LOCALIZATION.md`](../../docs/LOCALIZATION.md) for developer details on how translations are managed.
